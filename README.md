Lorem ipsum generator in PHP without dependencies. Compatible with PHP 5.3+.

## Origins

Once upon a time, I was attempting to find a lorem ipsum generator over on
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/search/?q=lorem%20ipsum). I was presented with
many options, and some of those options were good. Unfortunately, the bulk of
those options depended on Symphony or the Zend Framework. This wouldn’t have
been a big deal but under the circumstances, I wanted something that was not
tightly coupled to these frameworks because I wanted to use the generator in my
_own_ framework.

I had decided to use
[badcow/lorem-ipsum](https://packagist.org/packages/badcow/lorem-ipsum) because
it did not have any dependencies nor did it rely on any external APIs.  As I
started to use the library, I found that I was going to have to fight with it to
get it to do what I wanted. After digging through the code, I realized that I
was going to end up gutting most of it to bend it to my will.  I know when you
overhaul someone’s code the likelihood of them accepting a pull request goes
down dramatically, hence building this library while taking cues from it’s
predecessor.

Also, the aforementioned package had a bunch of “setter” and “getter” methods
that were grossing me out :scream:

## Installation

The preferred installation method is via `composer`. First add the following to
your `composer.json`

```json
"require": {
    "joshtronic/php-loremipsum": "dev-master"
}
```

Then run `composer update`

## Usage

### Getting Started

```php
$lipsum = new joshtronic\LoremIpsum();
```

### Generating Words

```php
echo '1 word: ' . $lipsum->word();
echo '5 words: ' . $lipsum->words(5);
```

### Generating sentences

```php
echo '1 sentence: ' . $lipsum->sentence();
echo '5 sentences: ' . $lipsum->sentences(5);
```

### Generating paragraphs

```php
echo '1 paragraph: ' . $lipsum->paragraph();
echo '5 paragraphs: ' . $lipsum->paragraphs(5);
```

### Wrapping text with HTML tags

If you would like to wrap the generated text with a tag, pass it as the second
parameter:

```php
echo $lipsum->paragraphs(3, 'p');

// Generates: <p>Lorem ipsum...</p><p>...</p><p>...</p>
```

Multiple tags can also be specified:

```php
echo $lipsum->sentences(3, ['article', 'p']);

// Generates: <article><p>...</p></article><article><p>...</p></article><article><p>...</p></article>
```

And you can back reference using `$1`:

```php
echo $lipsum->words(3, '<li><a href="$1">$1</a></li>');

// Generates: <li><a href="...">...</a></li><li><a href="...">...</a></li><li><a href="...">...</a></li>
```

### Return as an array

Perhaps you want an array instead of a string:

```php
print_r($lipsum->wordsArray(5));
print_r($lipsum->sentencesArray(5));
print_r($lipsum->paragraphsArray(5));
```

You can still wrap with markup when returning an array:

```php
print_r($lipsum->wordsArray(5, 'li'));
```

## Assumptions

Instead of having an option as to whether or not a string should start the
generated output with “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.”
a few assumptions are baked in. The first string generated will always start
with the traditional “Lorem ipsum…”. Subsequent strings may contain those words
but will not explicitly start with them.

## Contributing

Suggestions and bug reports are always welcome, but karma points are earned for
pull requests.

Unit tests are required for all contributions. You can run the test suite from
the `tests` directory simply by running `phpunit .`
